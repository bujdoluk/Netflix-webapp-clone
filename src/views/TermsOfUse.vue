          <h1>Netflix Terms of Use</h1><br>
          <p>Netflix provides a personalized subscription service that allows our members to access movies and TV shows ("Netflix
             content") streamed over the Internet to certain Internet-connected TVs, computers and other devices ("Netflix ready
             devices").<br>
             <br>
          </p>
          <p>These Terms of Use govern your use of our service. As used in these Terms of Use, "Netflix service", "our service" or "the
             service" means the personalized service provided by Netflix for discovering and watching Netflix content, including all
             features and functionalities, recommendations and reviews, the website, and user interfaces, as well as all content and
             software associated with our service.<br>

                Your Netflix membership will continue until terminated. To use the Netflix service you must have Internet access
                and a Netflix ready device, and provide us with one or more Payment Methods. "Payment Method" means a current,
                valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time, and which may include payment through your
                account with a third party. Unless you cancel your membership before your billing date, you authorize us to charge the
                membership fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below).<br>

                which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details

                on hold in the event that we determine you are not eligible. Members of households with an existing or recent Netflix
                membership may not be eligible for certain introductory Offers. We may use information such as device ID, method of
                payment or an account email address used with an existing or recent Netflix membership to determine Offer eligibility.
                The eligibility requirements and other limitations and conditions will be disclosed when you sign-up for the Offer or in

                <u>Billing Cycle.</u> The membership fee for the Netflix service will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific
                payment date indicated on the  "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription
                that you choose when you signed up for the service. In some cases your payment date may change, for example if you
                Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid membership
                began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit our website and click on the "Billing details" link on the "Account"
                page to see your next payment date. If you signed up for Netflix using your account with a third party as a Payment
                Method, you can find the billing information about your Netflix membership by visiting your account with the applicable
                third party.<br>

                <li class="inner-list">
                <u>Payment Methods.</u> To use the Netflix service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You authorize us to
                charge any Payment Method associated to your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer
                available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is
                not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may
                suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment
                Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the
                processing of your Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with
                your Payment Method service provider for details.<br>

                also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following any
                update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s).<br>

                <u>Cancellation.</u> You can cancel your Netflix membership at any time, and you will continue to have access
                to the Netflix service through the end of your billing period. Payments are non-refundable and we do
                not provide refunds or credits for any partial membership periods or unwatched Netflix content. To
                cancel, go to the "Account" page and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your
                membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To 
                see when your account will close, click "Billing details" on the "Account" page. If you
                signed up for Netflix using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your
                Netflix membership, you may need to do so through such third party, for example by visiting your account
                with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the Netflix service through that third party.<br>

                The quality of the display of the Netflix content may vary from device to device, and may be affected by a variety
                of factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed of your Internet connection. HD,
                Ultra HD and HDR availability is subject to your Internet service and device capabilities. Not all content is
                available in all formats, such as HD, Ultra HD and HDR, and not all subscription plans allow you to receive
                content in all formats. Default playback settings on cellular networks exclude HD, Ultra HD and HDR content. The
                minimum connection speed for SD quality is 1.0 Mbps; however, we recommend a faster connection for improved
                video quality. A download speed of at least 3.0 Mbps per stream is recommended to receive HD content (defined
                as a resolution of 720p or higher). A download speed of at least 15.0 Mbps per stream is recommended to receive
                Ultra HD (defined as a resolution of 4K or higher). You are responsible for all Internet access charges. Please
                check with your Internet provider for information on possible Internet data usage charges. The time it takes to
