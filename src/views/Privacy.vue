           Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in

           the specific context in which we collect and use it. We will normally collect 
           personal information from you where we need the personal information to perform a 
           contract with you (for example, to provide our services to you), where the processing 
           is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or 
           fundamental rights and freedoms (for example, our direct marketing activities in accordance 
           with your preferences), or where we have your consent to do so (for example, for you to 
           participate in certain consumer insights activities like specific surveys and focus groups). 
           In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or 
           may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another 
           person (for example, to prevent payment fraud or confirm your identity). For questions about 
           our use of your personal information (including legal bases and transfer mechanisms we rely on), 
           cookies or similar technologies, please contact our Data Protection Officer/Privacy Office by 
           email at <a>privacy@netflix.com.</a> Please visit our online help center at <a>help.netflix.com</a> for more
